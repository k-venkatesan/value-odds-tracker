# Issue Flow

All development in the project is handled through issues on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/k-venkatesan/value-odds-tracker/issues).

### Creating a New Issue
A new issue can be created on GitHub by simply clicking the 'New issue' button.

#### Feature/Bug
If the issue is a new feature or a bug, give it an appropriate title, description and feature/bug label. 

#### User Story
To address a specific requirement within a broader feature, a user story needs to be created. This is an 
issue with the user story label, and title in the following format:

```
[Person] wants [requirement] to [reason].
```
(The exact wording can deviate from the template if it improves readability).

Use ones of the following personas to provide the appropriate point of view for the user story:

| Person   | Description                               |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Chrissy  | Developer that is working on this project |

Additionally, provide the following details in the description of the user story:
1. Feature that the user story is a part of
1. Acceptance criteria 

### Working on an Existing Issue
To work on a user story that has been created:
1. Assign it to yourself
1. Click on 'Create a branch' and accept the suggested branch name
1. Once the branch has been created, create a pull request to merge that branch into 'main' - give the pull request the 
same title as the user story
1. When changes are ready to be merged into the main branch, use the 'Squash and merge' button provided in the pull 
request.

The branch can now be checked out locally to implement changes.
