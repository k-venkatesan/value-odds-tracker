# Issue Flow

All development in the project is handled through issues on 
[Github](https://github.com/k-venkatesan/value-odds-tracker/issues).

### Creating a New Issue
A new issue can be created on Github by simply clicking the 'New issue' button.

#### Feature/Bug
If the issue is a new feature or a bug, give it an appropriate title, description and feature/bug label. 

#### User Story
To address a specific requirement within a broader feature, a user story needs to be created. This is an 
issue with the user story label, and title in the following format:

```
[Person] wants [requirement] to [reason].
```
(The exact wording can deviate from the template if it improves readability).

Use ones of the following personas to provide the appropriate point of view for the user story:

| Person   | Description                               |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Chrissy  | Developer that is working on this project |

Additionally, provide the following details in the description of the user story:
1. Feature that the user story is a part of
1. Acceptance criteria 

### Working on an Existing Issue
To work on a user story that has been created:
1. Assign it to yourself
1. Click on 'Create a branch' and accept the suggested branch name
1. Once the branch has been created, create a pull request to merge that branch into 'main' - give the pull request the 
same title as the user story 

The branch can now be checked out locally to implement changes.
